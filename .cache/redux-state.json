          "text": "There are many ways to lose a lot of weight fast. However, most of them will make you hungry and unsatisfied. If you don't have iron willpower, then hunger will cause you to give up on these plans quickly. The plan outlined here will: Reduce your appetite significantly. Make you lose weight quickly, without hunger. Improve your metabolic health at the same time. Here is a simple 3-step plan to lose weight fast. 1. Cut Back on Sugars and Starches The most important part is to cut back on sugars and starches (carbs). When you do that, your hunger levels go down and you end up eating much fewer calories. Now instead of burning carbs for energy, your body starts feeding off of stored fat. Another benefit of cutting carbs is that it lowers insulin levels, causing your kidneys to shed excess sodium and water out of your body. This reduces bloat and unnecessary water weight . It is not uncommon to lose up to 10 pounds (sometimes more) in the first week of eating this way, both body fat and water weight. This is a graph from a study comparing low-carb and low-fat diets in overweight or obese women . Share on Pinterest The low-carb group is eating until fullness, while the low-fat group is calorie-restricted and hungry. Cut the carbs and you will start to eat fewer calories automatically and without hunger. Put simply, cutting carbs puts fat loss on autopilot. SUMMARYRemoving sugars and starches (carbs) from your diet will reduce your appetite, lower your insulin levels and make you lose weight without hunger. 2. Eat Protein, Fat and Vegetables Each one of your meals should include a protein source, a fat source and low-carb vegetables. Constructing your meals in this way will automatically bring your carb intake into the recommended range of 20–50 grams per day. Protein Sources Meat: Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc. Fish and Seafood: Salmon, trout, shrimp, etc. Eggs: Whole eggs with the yolk are best. The importance of eating plenty of protein cannot be overstated. This has been shown to boost metabolism by 80 to 100 calories per day. High-protein diets can also reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%, reduce the desire for late-night snacking by half, and make you so full that you automatically eat 441 fewer calories per day — just by adding protein to your diet . When it comes to losing weight, protein is the king of nutrients. Period. Low-Carb Vegetables Broccoli Cauliflower Spinach Tomatoes Kale Brussels sprouts Cabbage Swiss chard Lettuce Cucumber Full list here. Don’t be afraid to load your plate with these low-carb vegetables. You can eat massive amounts of them without going over 20–50 net carbs per day. A diet based mostly on meat and vegetables contains all the fiber, vitamins and minerals you need to be healthy. Fat Sources Olive oil Coconut oil Avocado oil Butter Eat 2–3 meals per day. If you find yourself hungry in the afternoon, add a 4th meal. Don’t be afraid of eating fat, as trying to do both low-carb AND low-fat at the same time is a recipe for failure. It will make you feel miserable and abandon the plan. To see how you can assemble your meals, check out this low-carb meal plan and this list of 101 healthy low-carb recipes. SUMMARYAssemble each meal out of a protein source, a fat source and low-carb vegetables. This will put you in the 20–50 gram carb range and significantly lower your hunger levels. 3. Lift Weights 3 Times Per Week You don't need to exercise to lose weight on this plan, but it is recommended. The best option is to go to the gym 3–4 times a week. Do a warm-up and lift some weights. If you're new to the gym, ask a trainer for some advice. By lifting weights, you will burn lots of calories and prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight. Studies on low-carb diets show that you can even gain a bit of muscle while losing significant amounts of body fat . If lifting weights is not an option for you, then doing some cardio workouts like walking, jogging, running, cycling or swimming will suffice. SUMMARYIt is best to do some sort of resistance training like weight lifting. If that is not an option, cardio workouts are also effective. Optional — Do a \"Carb Refeed\" Once Per Week You can take one day off per week where you eat more carbs. Many people prefer Saturday. It is important to stick to healthy carb sources like oats, rice, quinoa, potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruit, etc. But only this one higher carb day — if you start doing it more often than once per week you're not going to see much success on this plan. If you must have a cheat meal and eat something unhealthy, then do it on this day. Be aware that cheat meals or carb refeeds are NOT necessary, but they can boost some fat-burning hormones like leptin and thyroid hormones. You will gain some weight during your refeed day, but most of it will be water weight and you will lose it again in the next 1–2 days. SUMMARYHaving one day each week where you eat more carbs is perfectly acceptable, although not necessary. What About Calories and Portion Control? It is NOT necessary to count calories as long as you keep the carbs very low and stick to protein, fat and low-carb vegetables. However, if you really want to count them, use this calculator. Enter your details, and then pick the number from either the \"Lose Weight\" or the \"Lose Weight Fast\" section — depending on how fast you want to lose weight. There are many great tools you can use to track the number of calories you are eating. Here is a list of 5 calorie counters that are free and easy to use. The main goal of this plan is to keep carbs under 20–50 grams per day and get the rest of your calories from protein and fat. SUMMARYIt is not necessary to count calories to lose weight on this plan. It is most important to strictly keep your carbs in the 20–50 gram range.",

The reason people tell you this is because they think that if you are losing weight quickly, you are doing so in a way that harms your body. Nothing in this post is harmful to you and nothing is voodoo.</p><p>You won’t be told to take fat-burner bills that keep you up for the next 5 days.</p><p>Instead, I will share 5 steps with you to lose weight fast. These aren’t steps that you can skip either. Think of these as being written in stone.</p><p>If you decide not to follow them then that is on you.</p><h2>Why Is Losing Weight Fast Good for You?</h2><p>Before we dive into the steps I want to take the time to answer this question. Losing weight fast has a number of benefits that you should consider.</p><h3>Do More in the Short Term to Achieve More in the Long Term</h3><p>Studies have shown that those who lose the most weight in the first 2-4 weeks of dieting have the greatest weight loss results in the following year.</p><p>So that means losing weight in the short term has a positive effect on the long-term results.</p><h3>Keeps You Motivated</h3><p>You know what one of the worst things is when you are trying to lose weight? Not actually losing weight!</p><p>This is why people that are trying to diet will try between 3 to 4 different diets a year. Nothing seems to be working so they keep on looking!</p><p>When you don’t get results that can leave you frustrated and can kill your motivation completely. When you do get results you want to keep that momentum going.</p><p>Think about it. You are on a weight loss program which usually means you need to change your routine. Odds are you probably like your routine because you continue to do it so if you are going to change it, it better be for something that works.</p><p>If it doesn’t work you quickly fall back into your old routine that isn’t working for you either, but at least it’s something that you like.</p><p>Now imagine your new routine is starting to show results in 3 days. What do you think will happen then? You wake up a little more upbeat than usual. You have no problem ignoring that cupcake at work.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because things are working for you.</p><p>When you see results it is easier to stay motivated and stick with the new routine. When you don’t see results you ask yourself what is the point?</p><p>Lose weight faster, stay motivated longer.</p><h3>Nobody Dies From Losing Weight Quickly</h3><p>We aren’t talking about the extreme things that boxers and UFC fighters do with their bodies, but have you ever heard of someone dying from trying to lose weight quickly in a responsible way?</p><p>It just doesn’t happen!</p><p>However, how many people die from being overweight? You don’t have to look it up because I’ll tell you.</p><p><strong>300,000</strong>.</p><p>There are over 300,000 obesity related deaths a year just in the United States alone. It’s an epidemic.</p><p>Thinking that losing weight quickly is a bad thing is a crazy thing to think. None of the methods that you’ll learn below will deprive your body of the nutrients that it needs so there is no fear in losing weight quickly.</p><p>The only fear should be of not starting at all.</p><h2>How to Lose Weight Fast: the 5 Steps</h2><p>Now, just because there are only 5 steps doesn’t mean this will be a breeze. In theory, all of this should be easy, but that’s how most people approach these things.</p><p>These steps aren’t miracles but they do work if you apply yourself.</p><p>Step 0 is understanding that this is all on you. If you want to make it happen you can make it happen.</p><h3>1. Get Rid of Carbs</h3><p>You’ve probably heard of this one before, but carbohydrates are the #1 reason why people become overweight.</p><p><em>If you want to learn more about carbs then check out our <strong>easy guide to carbs</strong>.</em></p><p>To get started on your quick weight loss plan you need to do a <strong>carb detox</strong>. You need to flush all of the bad carb stuff from your body. This has nothing to do with calories. This has everything to do with the twinkie that you made disappear in 3 seconds.</p><p>Doing a carb detox will reduce your calories and force your body to flush out any excess water weight. Don’t be surprised if this results in a 5-8 pound drop in weight during the first week.</p><p>This is also why many people gain the weight back so quickly after they eat a plate of spaghetti.</p><p>Another plus to this, especially those prone to diabetes, is that it will help to reset your body’s insulin levels and become more sensitive to carbohydrates when you do bring them back into your diet.</p><p>What? Did you think you were done with carbs forever? Psh, nobody is done with carbs forever.</p><p>While doing this process you might also find that your body enters a state of ketosis. What follows is what is commonly known as <em>keto flu</em>. You might experience headaches and other flu-like symptoms for a couple of days. Crazy things happen when you begin to flush out the toxins from your body and restart it.</p><h3>2. Sleep Like a Baby</h3><p>In my 20s I didn’t really care about sleep. I would stay up late either working, gaming, or partying. I would catch up on sleep in the morning and then hit the routine again.</p><p>It wasn’t good at all.</p><p>Many people that are trying to lose weight fail to do so because they don’t get proper sleep. It makes sense because you don’t really associate sleep with losing weight, but it’s a really big deal.</p><p>One of the worst things about getting a lack of sleep is that your willpower reserves start to drop. When your willpower is low that’s when you begin to make poor food decisions. It’s a slippery slope from thinking that one Oreo won’t hurt to finally eating the whole pizza on your own.</p><p>Good sleep also ensures that your hormones are functioning properly. You never want to throw your hormones out of whack because it completely disrupts everything that you have going for you.</p><h3>3. Eat a Lot of Protein and Low-Carb Vegetables Cooked in High-Quality Fats</h3><p>Okay, so you’ve cut out the carbs and have an awesome game plan for getting a good night’s sleep, but you probably want to eat at some point.</p><p>So what do you eat?</p><p>When you are doing your detox you want to consume a ton of protein every chance you get. The reason why is because your body has to find a new energy source since you are depriving it of all of the sweet sugars you used to give it.</p><p>Protein becomes that new energy source.</p><p>Foods like organic chicken and eggs, beef, and salmon are a great source of protein. If you aren’t trying to chew food 16 hours a day then consider finding a good whey protein to add to the mix.</p><p>The fun doesn’t stop there. You will want to cover these foods in high-quality fats. Not pig lard, but extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil.</p><p>If you think these fats are a bad thing you are sorely mistaken. They are a blessing. Not only do they add awesome flavor to your meals, but they also provide another energy source for your body.</p><p>Be sure to add some low-carb vegetables to the side as well. If you didn’t know that vegetables are a source of carbs then make sure you read our <strong>guide to carbs</strong>.</p><h3>4. Anaerobic Exercise 3x per Week</h3><p>This is a tricky step because common sense tells you that you should be exercising while dieting and at some point you should. It shouldn’t happen when you are going through your detox though because your body is adjusting and it’s pretty hard to convince your mind to eat differently and start a new workout routine.</p><p>Because of the carb detox you will already be losing weight so you want to keep that momentum going. Working out requires your body to burn through its energy sources and because your body is still adjusting that usually means that if you work out now that donut looks much more appealing later.</p><p>However, once you’re done with your detox you can start to insert some exercise because you will start to eat some carbs again. The reason why you are taking this approach is because you want to prevent something called the down-regulation of metabolism.</p><p>What is that? Excellent question!</p><p>It is when your body’s metabolism rate slows down because you are eating less food. You want to include exercise in your regimen so it doesn’t continue to slow down and all it takes is exercising 3x a week.</p><p>The best type of exercise you can do for this in our opinion is circuit training.</p><h3>5. Focus on the Quality of Your Food</h3><p>Knowing <strong>how to read food labels</strong> is important, but you never want to end up just reducing your food to numbers. You want your body to enjoy everything that you consume and you want to feel good about it later.</p><p>The problem with just reducing food to just numbers is that you can find sneaky ways to get a box of chocolate chip cookies into your daily diet if you skimp out on other things.</p><p>But how are those cookies going to make you feel? While they may help you reach your daily carb limit are they providing any other nutrients that your body needs?</p><p>A huge mindset win for you will occur when you can stop thinking about just the taste of a food and also start thinking about how it is going to make you feel later.</p><p>Almost everything good that I like to eat that is bad for me results in me feeling even worse later.</p><h2>Nothing Is Happening</h2><p>If you follow these steps and nothing is happening then there is a good chance you are consuming too much food. Low-carb vegetables are great to eat but if you are consuming 50lbs worth a day you shouldn’t expect to lose any weight.</p><p>If you aren’t seeing any results then it becomes time to count your calories. It’s pretty difficult to eat more than your daily calorie count, but it’s not impossible.</p>",

Satisfy your thirst with water, sparkling water with citrus, skim or low-fat milk, or small portions of 100% fruit juice. Try a glass of nutritious and low-calorie vegetable juice to hold you over if you get hungry between meals. Be careful of alcohol calories, which add up quickly. If you tend to drink a glass or two of wine or a cocktail on most days, limiting alcohol to the weekends can be a huge calorie saver.</li><li><strong>Eat More Produce.</strong> Eating lots of low-calorie, high-volume fruits and vegetables crowds out other foods that are higher in fat and calories. Move the meat off the center of your plate and pile on the vegetables. Or try starting lunch or dinner with a vegetable salad or bowl of broth-based soup, suggests Barbara Rolls, PhD, author of <em>The VolumetricsEating Plan</em>. The U.S. government&#39;s 2005 Dietary Guidelines suggest that adults get 7-13 cups of produce daily. Ward says that&#39;s not really so difficult: &quot;Stock your kitchen with plenty of fruits and vegetables and at every meal and snack, include a few servings,&quot; she says. &quot;Your diet will be enriched with vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, fiber, and if you fill up on super-nutritious produce, you won&#39;t be reaching for the cookie jar.&quot;</li><li><strong>Go for the Grain. </strong>By substituting whole grains for refined grains like white bread, cakes, cookies, and pretzels, you add much-needed fiber and will fill up faster so you&#39;re more likely to eat a reasonable portion. Choose whole-wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, bran flakes, popcorn, and whole-rye crackers.</li><li><strong>Control Your Environments.</strong> Another simple strategy to help cut calories is to control your environment -- everything from stocking your kitchen with lots of healthy options to choosing the right restaurants. That means avoiding the temptation by staying away from all-you-can-eat restaurants. And when it comes to parties, &quot;eat a healthy snack before so you won&#39;t be starving, and be selective when you fill your plate at the buffet,&quot; suggests Ward. Before going back for more food, wait at least 15 minutes and have a big glass of water.</li><li><strong>Trim Portions.</strong> If you did nothing else but reduce your portions by 10%-20%, you would lose weight. Most of the portions served both in restaurants and at home are bigger than you need. Pull out the measuring cups to get a handle on your usual portion sizes, and work on paring them down. Get instant portion control by using small bowls, plates, and cups, says Brian Wansink, PhD, author of <em>Mindless Eating.</em> You won&#39;t feel deprived because the food will look plentiful on dainty dishware.</li><li><strong>Add More Steps.</strong> Get yourself a pedometer and gradually add more steps until you reach 10,000 per day. Throughout the day, do whatever you can to be more active -- pace while you talk on the phone, take the dog out for an extra walk, and march in place during television commercials. Having a pedometer serves as a constant motivator and reminder.</li><li><strong>Have Protein at Every Meal and Snack. </strong>Adding a source of lean or low-fat protein to each meal and snack will help keep you feeling full longer so you&#39;re less likely to overeat. Try low-fat yogurt, small portion of nuts, peanut butter, eggs, beans, or lean meats. Experts also recommend eating small, frequent meals and snacks (every 3-4 hours), to keep your blood sugar levels steady and to avoid overindulging.</li><li><strong>Switch to Lighter Alternatives.</strong> Whenever you can, use the low-fat versions of salad dressings, mayonnaise, dairy products, and other products. &quot;You can trim calories effortlessly if you use low-fat and lighter products, and if the product is mixed in with other ingredients, no one will ever notice,&quot; says Magee. More smart substitutions: Use salsa or hummus as a dip; spread sandwiches with mustard instead of mayo; eat plain roasted sweet potatoes instead of loaded white potatoes; use skim milk instead of cream in your coffee; hold the cheese on sandwiches; and use a little vinaigrette on your salad instead of piling on the creamy dressing.</li></ol>",

          "html": "<p>Are you eating well and exercising, but your weight just won&#39;t budge? Or it&#39;s going up? Desperate attempts to lose weight can be so frustrating and create a real stress in our lives. In fact, I&#39;ll go as far as saying that weight is the NUMBER ONE stress for women I know.</p><p>It&#39;s a vicious cycle of trying to control what we eat, feeling like a failure because the scale doesn&#39;t move, punishing ourselves for not being &quot;more in control,&quot; and then manifesting a huge amount of bodily stress that causes further havoc in our bodies. Then we binge or take our diet to an extreme (never healthy) and the cycle continues…</p><p>Oh gosh I’ve exhausted myself just typing that!</p><p>Our self-esteem is measured by what the scales say, right?</p><p>Of course not, but that’s what I believed. Now I believe that when we are kinder to ourselves, and practice positive thinking, our body will start to work in our favor. And the weight will go down.</p><p>Of course it’s not <em>thaat</em> simple, but it&#39;s the first part of being more in control of your own body weight.</p><p>And it doesn&#39;t need to be such a stress! There <em>is</em> a way to live without worrying about your weight and watching everything that enters your mouth. Once we have the skills in place to find happiness and psychological wellbeing, healthy eating habits (and a healthy weight) will follow easily.</p><p><strong>Here are 14 reasons you may be hitting the wall with your weight…</strong></p><p><strong>1. Your hormones aren&#39;t balanced.</strong></p><p>If you are fatigued, suffer from PMS, experience irregular menstrual cycles, find it hard to lose weight, feel depressed or anxious, you may have a hormonal imbalance. Best to see a nutritionist or doctor who can support you and suggest certain tests that will confirm this so you can take appropriate action.</p><p><strong>2. You&#39;re not getting enough Vitamin D.</strong></p><p>A huge number of the population have low Vitamin D, which is associated with weight gain and several metabolic processes. If you spend much of your life indoors, get your Vitamin D checked with your doctor.</p><p><strong>3. You&#39;re exercising, but not in a way that’s benefiting your body!</strong></p><p>You are either exercising too much or you need to mix it up a bit and give the body a bit of a shock. (Funnily enough, most people I see who over exercise tend to put on weight easily.) Enjoy a variety of workout techniques: weight training, Pilates, yoga and interval training. Quick and hard bursts are good. And weight training is very helpful to raise your metabolism.</p><p><strong>4. Your digestion and absorption is not optimal.</strong></p><p>You are not what you eat; you are what you digest and absorb! Our gut health will determine our overall wellbeing. The bacteria that lies in our gut helps us to fight disease, process our food, make nutrients and make hormones etc.</p><p><strong>5. You&#39;re sitting on your ass all day.</strong></p><p>You&#39;re not moving your body enough throughout the day, and your body does not like this. I understand some of your have office jobs and are tied to your desk, but is it possible to go for a few minute stroll every hour? Or walk 20 minutes to grab lunch?</p><p><strong>6. You&#39;re eating too much.</strong></p><p>I&#39;d love to be able to say you can eat as much healthy food as you like, but unfortunately this is just not the case. The body cannot cope with a lot of food at once. It&#39;s vital to put good portions on your plate. (I usually say: ¼ of the plate should be protein, ¼ carbohydrate and ½ veggies.)

          "text": "Are you eating well and exercising, but your weight just won't budge? Or it's going up? Desperate attempts to lose weight can be so frustrating and create a real stress in our lives. In fact, I'll go as far as saying that weight is the NUMBER ONE stress for women I know. It's a vicious cycle of trying to control what we eat, feeling like a failure because the scale doesn't move, punishing ourselves for not being \"more in control,\" and then manifesting a huge amount of bodily stress that causes further havoc in our bodies. Then we binge or take our diet to an extreme (never healthy) and the cycle continues… Oh gosh I’ve exhausted myself just typing that! Our self-esteem is measured by what the scales say, right? Of course not, but that’s what I believed. Now I believe that when we are kinder to ourselves, and practice positive thinking, our body will start to work in our favor. And the weight will go down. Of course it’s not thaat simple, but it's the first part of being more in control of your own body weight. And it doesn't need to be such a stress! There is a way to live without worrying about your weight and watching everything that enters your mouth. Once we have the skills in place to find happiness and psychological wellbeing, healthy eating habits (and a healthy weight) will follow easily. Here are 14 reasons you may be hitting the wall with your weight… 1. Your hormones aren't balanced. If you are fatigued, suffer from PMS, experience irregular menstrual cycles, find it hard to lose weight, feel depressed or anxious, you may have a hormonal imbalance. Best to see a nutritionist or doctor who can support you and suggest certain tests that will confirm this so you can take appropriate action. 2. You're not getting enough Vitamin D. A huge number of the population have low Vitamin D, which is associated with weight gain and several metabolic processes. If you spend much of your life indoors, get your Vitamin D checked with your doctor. 3. You're exercising, but not in a way that’s benefiting your body! You are either exercising too much or you need to mix it up a bit and give the body a bit of a shock. (Funnily enough, most people I see who over exercise tend to put on weight easily.) Enjoy a variety of workout techniques: weight training, Pilates, yoga and interval training. Quick and hard bursts are good. And weight training is very helpful to raise your metabolism. 4. Your digestion and absorption is not optimal. You are not what you eat; you are what you digest and absorb! Our gut health will determine our overall wellbeing. The bacteria that lies in our gut helps us to fight disease, process our food, make nutrients and make hormones etc. 5. You're sitting on your ass all day. You're not moving your body enough throughout the day, and your body does not like this. I understand some of your have office jobs and are tied to your desk, but is it possible to go for a few minute stroll every hour? Or walk 20 minutes to grab lunch? 6. You're eating too much. I'd love to be able to say you can eat as much healthy food as you like, but unfortunately this is just not the case. The body cannot cope with a lot of food at once. It's vital to put good portions on your plate. (I usually say: ¼ of the plate should be protein, ¼ carbohydrate and ½ veggies.) Fill that plate with your greens, my love, and eat 5 to 6 small meals a day. We must learn to listen to our bodies when it's full and to stop eating! We all need to work on this. 7. You're not chewing your food. Chewing your food until it's liquid will really help with weight loss and better digestive performance. 8. You're stressed and not finding balance in your days. Stress can impact your weight in a number of ways. Long term stress = high cortisol, which is linked to blood sugar imbalance and weight gain around the mid-section. 9. You're not sleeping enough. Sleep = repair. When your body gets enough rest, it's able to perform. 10. You're a fad dieter. This is not way of life. I often ask people are you weight conscious or health conscious? They're very different mentalities that foster very different choices. 11. You're eating out too much and not cooking at home.

Unless you're dining at a place that claims healthy cooking and uses healthy produce, learn to love your kitchen! 12, You're not adding protein to your plate. Protein is the satiety macronutrient that helps us to balance out blood sugars and therefore helps to control our weight 13. You're scared of good fats. Don't be!
