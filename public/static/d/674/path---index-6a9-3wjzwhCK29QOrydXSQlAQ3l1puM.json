Cut Back on Sugars and Starches</h2><p>The most important part is to cut back on sugars and starches (carbs).</p><p>When you do that, your hunger levels go down and you end up eating much fewer calories (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17228046\">1</a>).</p><p>Now instead of burning carbs for energy, your body starts feeding off of stored fat.</p><p>Another benefit of cutting carbs is that it <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-ways-to-lower-insulin\">lowers insulin levels</a>, causing your kidneys to shed excess sodium and water out of your body. This reduces bloat and unnecessary water weight (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajprenal.00149.2007\">2</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20107198\">3</a>).</p><p>It is not uncommon to lose <strong>up to 10 pounds</strong> (sometimes more) in the first week of eating this way, both body fat and water weight.</p><p>This is a graph from a study comparing low-carb and low-fat diets in overweight or obese women (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12679447\">4</a>).</p><p>Share on Pinterest</p><p>The low-carb group is eating until fullness, while the low-fat group is <strong>calorie-restricted and hungry.</strong></p><p>Cut the carbs and you will start to eat fewer calories automatically and without hunger (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obr.12230/abstract\">5</a>).</p><p>Put simply, cutting carbs puts fat loss on <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-ways-to-lose-weight-without-counting-calories\">autopilot.</a></p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>Removing sugars and starches (carbs) from your diet will reduce your appetite, lower your insulin levels and make you lose weight without hunger.</p><h2>2. Eat Protein, Fat and Vegetables</h2><p>Each one of your meals should include a protein source, a fat source and low-carb vegetables.</p><p>Constructing your meals in this way will automatically bring your carb intake into the <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-carbs-per-day-to-lose-weight\">recommended range</a> of 20–50 grams per day.</p><h3>Protein Sources</h3><ul><li><strong>Meat:</strong> Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc.</li><li><strong>Fish and Seafood:</strong> Salmon, trout, shrimp, etc.</li><li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Whole eggs with the yolk are best.</li></ul><p>The importance of eating <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day\">plenty of protein</a> cannot be overstated.</p><p>This has been shown to boost metabolism by 80 to 100 calories per day (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640952\">6</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11838888\">7</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565999\">8</a>).</p><p>High-protein diets can also reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%, reduce the desire for late-night snacking by half, and make you so full that you automatically eat 441 fewer calories per day — just by <strong>adding</strong> protein to your diet (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20847729\">9</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/1/41/4863422\">10</a>).</p><p>When it comes to losing weight, protein is the <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-protein-can-help-you-lose-weight\">king of nutrients</a>. Period.</p><h3>Low-Carb Vegetables</h3><ul><li>Broccoli</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Kale</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Cucumber</li><li>Full list <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/21-best-low-carb-vegetables\">here.</a></li></ul><p>Don’t be afraid to load your plate with these low-carb vegetables. You can eat massive amounts of them without going over 20–50 net carbs per day.</p><p>A diet based mostly on meat and vegetables contains all the fiber, vitamins and minerals you need to be healthy.</p><h3>Fat Sources</h3><ul><li>Olive oil</li><li>Coconut oil</li><li>Avocado oil</li><li>Butter</li></ul><p>Eat 2–3 meals per day. If you find yourself hungry in the afternoon, add a 4th meal.</p><p>Don’t be afraid of eating fat, as trying to do both low-carb AND low-fat at the same time is a recipe for failure. It will make you feel miserable and abandon the plan.</p><p>To see how you can assemble your meals, check out this <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diet-meal-plan-and-menu\">low-carb meal plan</a> and this list of <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/101-healthy-low-carb-recipes\">101 healthy low-carb recipes</a>.</p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>Assemble each meal out of a protein source, a fat source and low-carb vegetables. This will put you in the 20–50 gram carb range and significantly lower your hunger levels.</p><h2>3. Lift Weights 3 Times Per Week</h2><p>You don&#39;t <em>need</em> to exercise to lose weight on this plan, but it is recommended.</p><p>The best option is to go to the gym 3–4 times a week. Do a warm-up and lift some weights.</p><p>If you&#39;re new to the gym, ask a trainer for some advice.</p><p>By lifting weights, you will burn lots of calories and prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18356845\">11</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200636030-00005\">12</a>).</p><p>Studies on low-carb diets show that you can even gain a bit of muscle while losing significant amounts of body fat (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049502000100\">13</a>).</p><p>If <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cardio-vs-weights-for-weight-loss\">lifting weights</a> is not an option for you, then doing some cardio workouts like walking, jogging, running, cycling or swimming will suffice.</p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>It is best to do some sort of resistance training like weight lifting. If that is not an option, cardio workouts are also effective.</p><h2>Optional — Do a &quot;Carb Refeed&quot; Once Per Week</h2><p>You can take one day off per week where you eat more carbs. Many people prefer Saturday.</p><p>It is important to stick to healthy carb sources like oats, rice, quinoa, potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruit, etc.</p><p>But only this one higher carb day — if you start doing it more often than once per week you&#39;re not going to see much success on this plan.</p><p>If you must have a cheat meal and eat something unhealthy, then do it on this day.</p><p>Be aware that cheat meals or carb refeeds are NOT necessary, but they can boost some <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-fixes-for-weight-hormones\">fat-burning hormones</a> like leptin and thyroid hormones (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336\">14</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3510362\">15</a>).</p><p>You will gain some weight during your refeed day, but most of it will be <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-ways-to-lose-water-weight\">water weight</a> and you will lose it again in the next 1–2 days.</p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>Having one day each week where you eat more carbs is perfectly acceptable, although not necessary.</p><h2>What About Calories and Portion Control?</h2><p>It is NOT necessary to count calories as long as you keep the carbs very low and stick to protein, fat and low-carb vegetables.</p><p>However, if you really want to count them, use <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day\">this calculator</a>.</p><p>Enter your details, and then pick the number from either the &quot;Lose Weight&quot; or the &quot;Lose Weight Fast&quot; section — depending on how fast you want to lose weight.</p><p>There are many great tools you can use to track the number of calories you are eating. Here is a <a  href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-best-calorie-counters\">list of 5 calorie counters</a> that are free and easy to use.</p><p>The main goal of this plan is to keep carbs under 20–50 grams per day and get the rest of your calories from protein and fat.</p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>It is not necessary to count calories to lose weight on this plan. It is most important to strictly keep your carbs in the 20–50 gram range.</p>"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}
