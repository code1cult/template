That’s it. Once you understand how your body works then it becomes a lot easier to lose weight. The problem is many people go around trying a million different things that all conflict with each other and when they don’t see the results that they want they think that it is impossible to lose weight. It’s quite possible to lose weight quickly if you take the right steps. What constitutes quick weight loss? How about 7lbs in 7 days? That sounds pretty awesome! If you think that is impossible you are thinking about this all wrong. First, you need to be positive! Second, it’s definitely possible because one of the first things that you will learn to do is to stop sabotaging your body. Now you might’ve been told that you should lose weight slowly. The reason people tell you this is because they think that if you are losing weight quickly, you are doing so in a way that harms your body. Nothing in this post is harmful to you and nothing is voodoo. You won’t be told to take fat-burner bills that keep you up for the next 5 days. Instead, I will share 5 steps with you to lose weight fast. These aren’t steps that you can skip either. Think of these as being written in stone. If you decide not to follow them then that is on you. Why Is Losing Weight Fast Good for You? Before we dive into the steps I want to take the time to answer this question. Losing weight fast has a number of benefits that you should consider. Do More in the Short Term to Achieve More in the Long Term Studies have shown that those who lose the most weight in the first 2-4 weeks of dieting have the greatest weight loss results in the following year. So that means losing weight in the short term has a positive effect on the long-term results. Keeps You Motivated You know what one of the worst things is when you are trying to lose weight? Not actually losing weight! This is why people that are trying to diet will try between 3 to 4 different diets a year. Nothing seems to be working so they keep on looking! When you don’t get results that can leave you frustrated and can kill your motivation completely. When you do get results you want to keep that momentum going. Think about it. You are on a weight loss program which usually means you need to change your routine. Odds are you probably like your routine because you continue to do it so if you are going to change it, it better be for something that works. If it doesn’t work you quickly fall back into your old routine that isn’t working for you either, but at least it’s something that you like. Now imagine your new routine is starting to show results in 3 days. What do you think will happen then? You wake up a little more upbeat than usual. You have no problem ignoring that cupcake at work. Why? Because things are working for you. When you see results it is easier to stay motivated and stick with the new routine. When you don’t see results you ask yourself what is the point? Lose weight faster, stay motivated longer. Nobody Dies From Losing Weight Quickly We aren’t talking about the extreme things that boxers and UFC fighters do with their bodies, but have you ever heard of someone dying from trying to lose weight quickly in a responsible way? It just doesn’t happen! However, how many people die from being overweight? You don’t have to look it up because I’ll tell you. 300,000. There are over 300,000 obesity related deaths a year just in the United States alone. It’s an epidemic. Thinking that losing weight quickly is a bad thing is a crazy thing to think. None of the methods that you’ll learn below will deprive your body of the nutrients that it needs so there is no fear in losing weight quickly. The only fear should be of not starting at all. How to Lose Weight Fast: the 5 Steps Now, just because there are only 5 steps doesn’t mean this will be a breeze. In theory, all of this should be easy, but that’s how most people approach these things. These steps aren’t miracles but they do work if you apply yourself. Step 0 is understanding that this is all on you. If you want to make it happen you can make it happen. 1. Get Rid of Carbs You’ve probably heard of this one before, but carbohydrates are the #1 reason why people become overweight. If you want to learn more about carbs then check out our easy guide to carbs. To get started on your quick weight loss plan you need to do a carb detox. You need to flush all of the bad carb stuff from your body. This has nothing to do with calories. This has everything to do with the twinkie that you made disappear in 3 seconds. Doing a carb detox will reduce your calories and force your body to flush out any excess water weight. Don’t be surprised if this results in a 5-8 pound drop in weight during the first week. This is also why many people gain the weight back so quickly after they eat a plate of spaghetti. Another plus to this, especially those prone to diabetes, is that it will help to reset your body’s insulin levels and become more sensitive to carbohydrates when you do bring them back into your diet. What? Did you think you were done with carbs forever? Psh, nobody is done with carbs forever. While doing this process you might also find that your body enters a state of ketosis. What follows is what is commonly known as keto flu. You might experience headaches and other flu-like symptoms for a couple of days. Crazy things happen when you begin to flush out the toxins from your body and restart it. 2. Sleep Like a Baby In my 20s I didn’t really care about sleep. I would stay up late either working, gaming, or partying. I would catch up on sleep in the morning and then hit the routine again. It wasn’t good at all. Many people that are trying to lose weight fail to do so because they don’t get proper sleep. It makes sense because you don’t really associate sleep with losing weight, but it’s a really big deal. One of the worst things about getting a lack of sleep is that your willpower reserves start to drop. When your willpower is low that’s when you begin to make poor food decisions. It’s a slippery slope from thinking that one Oreo won’t hurt to finally eating the whole pizza on your own. Good sleep also ensures that your hormones are functioning properly. You never want to throw your hormones out of whack because it completely disrupts everything that you have going for you. 3. Eat a Lot of Protein and Low-Carb Vegetables Cooked in High-Quality Fats Okay, so you’ve cut out the carbs and have an awesome game plan for getting a good night’s sleep, but you probably want to eat at some point. So what do you eat? When you are doing your detox you want to consume a ton of protein every chance you get. The reason why is because your body has to find a new energy source since you are depriving it of all of the sweet sugars you used to give it. Protein becomes that new energy source. Foods like organic chicken and eggs, beef, and salmon are a great source of protein. If you aren’t trying to chew food 16 hours a day then consider finding a good whey protein to add to the mix. The fun doesn’t stop there. You will want to cover these foods in high-quality fats. Not pig lard, but extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil. If you think these fats are a bad thing you are sorely mistaken. They are a blessing. Not only do they add awesome flavor to your meals, but they also provide another energy source for your body. Be sure to add some low-carb vegetables to the side as well. If you didn’t know that vegetables are a source of carbs then make sure you read our guide to carbs. 4. Anaerobic Exercise 3x per Week This is a tricky step because common sense tells you that you should be exercising while dieting and at some point you should. It shouldn’t happen when you are going through your detox though because your body is adjusting and it’s pretty hard to convince your mind to eat differently and start a new workout routine. Because of the carb detox you will already be losing weight so you want to keep that momentum going. Working out requires your body to burn through its energy sources and because your body is still adjusting that usually means that if you work out now that donut looks much more appealing later. However, once you’re done with your detox you can start to insert some exercise because you will start to eat some carbs again. The reason why you are taking this approach is because you want to prevent something called the down-regulation of metabolism. What is that? Excellent question! It is when your body’s metabolism rate slows down because you are eating less food. You want to include exercise in your regimen so it doesn’t continue to slow down and all it takes is exercising 3x a week. The best type of exercise you can do for this in our opinion is circuit training. 5. Focus on the Quality of Your Food Knowing how to read food labels is important, but you never want to end up just reducing your food to numbers. You want your body to enjoy everything that you consume and you want to feel good about it later. The problem with just reducing food to just numbers is that you can find sneaky ways to get a box of chocolate chip cookies into your daily diet if you skimp out on other things. But how are those cookies going to make you feel? While they may help you reach your daily carb limit are they providing any other nutrients that your body needs? A huge mindset win for you will occur when you can stop thinking about just the taste of a food and also start thinking about how it is going to make you feel later. Almost everything good that I like to eat that is bad for me results in me feeling even worse later. Nothing Is Happening If you follow these steps and nothing is happening then there is a good chance you are consuming too much food. Low-carb vegetables are great to eat but if you are consuming 50lbs worth a day you shouldn’t expect to lose any weight. If you aren’t seeing any results then it becomes time to count your calories. It’s pretty difficult to eat more than your daily calorie count, but it’s not impossible.","html":"<p>Losing weight comes down to knowledge.</p><p>That’s it.</p><p>Once you understand how your body works then it becomes a lot easier to lose weight.
